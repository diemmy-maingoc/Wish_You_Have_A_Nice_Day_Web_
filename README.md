## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Random Messages:** Click the "A new page" button (with the heart icon) to receive a new positive or healing quote.
* **Light/Dark Mode:** Features a smooth toggle to switch between a warm Light theme and a soothing Dark theme.
* **Theme Persistence:** Automatically saves your Light/Dark mode preference (using `localStorage`) for your next visit.
* **Subtle Animations:** Includes a "page-turning" effect for new quotes and smooth transitions for theme changes, creating a pleasant user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built purely with vanilla web technologies (no frameworks):

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3:** Utilizes CSS Variables for efficient theme management (Light/Dark mode) and Flexbox for layout.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Handles the logic for generating random quotes, animations, and controlling the Dark Mode state.

## üå± Future Plans

This is the initial version of a project intended for long-term development, focusing on mental well-being and healing. Future plans may include:

* [ ] **User-Submitted Quotes:** Allow users to input their own favorite quotes, save them, and include them in the random message generator.
* [ ] **External API Integration:** Fetching a wider variety of quotes from an external API.
* [ ] **Ambient Music:** Adding optional, relaxing background music.
* [ ] **Blog Section:** Developing a small blog for sharing thoughts on psychology.
